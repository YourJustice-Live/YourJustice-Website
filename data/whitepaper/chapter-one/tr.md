## <a id="problem-and-conceptual-solution"></a>Chapter 1: Problem and Conceptual Solution

In the opening chapter, we will outline the pains of the existing equilibrium and offer our vision of possible solutions.

In short: against the backdrop of a technological leap, the world is experiencing a public relationship crisis.

The demand for decentralization is growing. We are working on a constructor that allows you to create social relationships in a clean legal environment. We expect the platform to help humanity achieve a safer and more equitable environment. To make it all work, you need the help of "agents of change": active and caring people.

### <a id="three-levels-of-failures"></a>3 levels of failures

At different levels of life, each of us encounters signs of suboptimal balance in the world.

**At the level of everyday life**, we notice imperfections in familiar, long-standing relationships:

- Teachers in schools do not communicate with children in the best way, children at the same time have problems with academic performance.
- Supervisors and subordinates play a "power game" instead of working together ecologically and effectively and creating overall value.
- Officials tend to give citizens the runaround without trying to solve their problems.
- Customers, implementers, and business partners make promises they can not (or will not) keep.
- Prices are rising, not falling, even though progress seems to have been promised otherwise.
- Even in personal relationships, things do not always go smoothly. Fairness, empathy and kindness are perceived as rarities and exceptions to the rule rather than something naturally occurring.
